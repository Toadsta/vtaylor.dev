# vtaylor.dev - A Node.js Website

vtaylor.dev is my personal website that I mainly made to just learn 
some more web programming skills. The website is a general about me 
site with links to my socials. It also contains VicOS which is meant to 
replicate the feel of Windows 95 because I thought [Teethy.ca](https://teethy.ca) 
was really cool

## Features and Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The website is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: General web programming shenanigans
- **EJS**: I decided to use EJS, so I can embed other pages into the base. This is similar to flask

[//]: # (The primary goal of vtaylor.dev is to establish my online website that will contain blog posts, and my portfolio. By utilizing Node.js and Bulma, I aim to create an engaging and user-friendly website that highlights my skills, projects, and achievements.)
